# 🎵 Lyrics for Success: Embedding Features for Song Popularity Prediction
## 📌 Project Overview 
This project explores the relationship between song lyrics and their success. Using **Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML)**, we analyze whether a song'lyrics alone can predict if it will become a **hit or not**. By leveraging **TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and ML models**, we aim to uncover patterns in lyrics that contribute to popularity. 

## Key Features 
- **Sentiment Analysis** 
- **Word Usage Patterns**
- **Embedding Techniques**
- **Hit Classification**

## Dataset 
Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/billboard-hot-100-audio-features 
## Project Workflow 
### 1. Data Preprocessing 
- Removed stopwords, punctuation, and lemmatized words.
- Tokenized lyrics for **feature extraction**. 
### 2. Feature Engineering 
- Converted lyrics into **TF-IDF vectors**
- Trained **Word2Vec embeddings** to capture word relationships.  
### 3. Model Training and Evaluation 
- **Baseline Models:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest
- **Advanced Models:** XGBoost, LSTM, Transformer-based LLMs.
- **Comparison:** Evaluated using **accuracy, precision, recall, F-1-score**.
